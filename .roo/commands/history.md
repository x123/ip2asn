description: "Condense history"
---

Take any fully completed chunk from plan.md, and condense it and append it to history.md, taking care to follow the *precise* format in use in history.md. I want plan.md to left with only the Phases which are not completed, then wait for my review. Make sure to keep the Phase numbers sequential in history.md, and do not remove any items from history.md, just from plan.md.
