# Historical Phases

Phases we have already completed.

## Part 1: Completed Milestones

*This section serves as a historical log of the project's evolution.*

**1. Phase 1: The Core Algorithm (`range_to_cidrs`)**
*   **[x] Chunk 1.1: Project Scaffolding:** Initialized the Rust library project and set up basic modules and dependencies.
*   **[x] Chunk 1.2: Foundational Cases (IPv4):** Implemented the core logic for converting simple, aligned IPv4 ranges into CIDRs.
*   **[x] Chunk 1.3: Complex & Generic Cases:** Expanded the algorithm to handle non-aligned ranges, IPv6, and edge cases, making it a generic IP range utility.

**2. Phase 2: Data Structures & Parsing Logic**
*   **[x] Chunk 2.1: Define All Data Types:** Defined the core internal and public-facing data structures like `AsnRecord` and `IpAsnMap`.
*   **[x] Chunk 2.2: Line Parser:** Implemented a robust parser to convert lines of TSV data into the internal `AsnRecord` struct, including error handling and data normalization.

**3. Phase 3: Building & Querying the Map**
*   **[x] Chunk 3.1: String Interner Utility:** Created a `StringInterner` to efficiently store and reuse organization name strings.
*   **[x] Chunk 3.2: Builder & Lookup Integration:** Assembled the core `Builder::build` logic, integrating the parser, `range_to_cidrs`, and string interner to construct a queryable `IpAsnMap`. Implemented the `lookup` method.

**4. Phase 4: I/O, Features, and Ergonomics**
*   **[x] Chunk 4.1: File I/O & Gzip Decompression:** Added support for building the map from local files, with transparent gzip decompression.
*   **[x] Chunk 4.2: `fetch` Feature & Network I/O:** Implemented the optional `fetch` feature to build the map directly from a URL, using `reqwest` and `wiremock` for testing.

**5. Phase 5: Final Polish & Release Prep**
*   **[x] Chunk 5.1: Harden Error Handling & Final Features:** Implemented strict mode and a warning callback system for handling parse errors gracefully.
*   **[x] Chunk 5.2: Verify Performance Contract:** Created a `criterion` benchmark suite to validate that build and lookup performance met the project's goals.
*   **[x] Chunk 5.3: Document the Final Product:** Wrote comprehensive crate-level documentation, public API docs, and a detailed `README.md`.

**6. Phase 6: Expose Network in Lookup**
*   **[x] Chunk 6.1: Enhance `AsnInfoView` and `lookup`:** Modified the `lookup` result to include the specific network that matched the query.
*   **[x] Chunk 6.2: Update Documentation:** Updated all documentation to reflect the new `network` field in the lookup result.

**7. Phase 6A: API Guideline Audit & Polish**
*   **[x] Chunks 6A.1-5: Systematic API Audit:** Performed a full audit of the public API against the official Rust API Guidelines, fixing dozens of minor issues related to naming, traits, error handling, and documentation to ensure an idiomatic and high-quality crate.

**8. Phase 7: Publish**
*   **[x] Chunk 7.1: Final Review & Publish:** Performed final checks and published version `0.1.0` of the `ip2asn` crate to `crates.io`.

**9. Phase 8: Ergonomic API Enhancements**
*   **[x] Chunk 8.1: Implement Empty Map Constructors:** Added `IpAsnMap::new()` and implemented the `Default` trait for easier construction.
*   **[x] Chunk 8.2: Implement Owned Lookup Variant:** Added an optional `serde` feature and a `lookup_owned` method to return an owned `AsnInfo` struct, simplifying use in async contexts.
*   **[x] Chunk 8.3: Update Documentation:** Updated the `README.md` and doc comments for the new ergonomic features.
