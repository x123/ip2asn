### CLI Auto-Update and Configuration

Completed the implementation of the automatic dataset update feature and configuration file support for the `ip2asn-cli` tool.

**Key Developments:**

*   **Configuration:** Added `config.rs` to manage loading a `config.toml` file from `~/.config/ip2asn/config.toml`. This file controls the `auto_update` feature.
*   **Directory Structure:** Switched from `directories::ProjectDirs` to `directories::BaseDirs` to use standard Unix-like paths (`~/.config/ip2asn` for config, `~/.cache/ip2asn` for data).
*   **Auto-Update Logic:** Implemented `check_for_updates()` in `main.rs`.
    *   The check is triggered on `lookup` if no explicit `--data` path is given.
    *   It only runs if `auto_update = true` in the config.
    *   It checks if the cached data is older than 24 hours.
    *   If it is, it performs a `HEAD` request to get the `Last-Modified` header from the remote data URL.
    *   If the remote file is newer, it triggers `run_update()` to download the new dataset.
*   **Output Handling:** Redirected all progress and status messages (`Checking for updates...`, `Downloading...`) to `stderr` to keep `stdout` clean for parsable results.

**Challenges & Solutions:**

*   **Test Flakiness:** The integration tests for the auto-update feature were initially very flaky when run in parallel.
    *   **Problem 1: Shared State:** Tests modified shared environment variables (`IP2ASN_CONFIG_PATH`, `IP2ASN_DATA_URL`), causing race conditions.
        *   **Solution:** Introduced a `lazy_static` `std::sync::Mutex` to serialize the execution of tests that modify the environment, ensuring they run one at a time while allowing other tests to remain parallel.
    *   **Problem 2: Empty `stderr` in `assert_cmd`:** In the `#[tokio::test]` environment, `assert_cmd` failed to capture `stderr` from the child process, even when output was being generated. The process appeared to exit before the `stderr` buffer was flushed.
        *   **Solution 1:** Added explicit `io::stderr().flush()?` calls after every `eprintln!` in the update logic. This fixed the issue for one test but not another.
        *   **Solution 2:** The final fix was discovering an interaction with the `tracing_subscriber::fmt().with_test_writer()`. Removing the subscriber initialization from the failing test allowed `assert_cmd` to correctly capture `stderr`.

This phase was a valuable lesson in the subtleties of testing CLI applications, especially when dealing with I/O, environment variables, and asynchronous test harnesses.
